# Findings & Research

## Initial State
- **Ollama**: Installed (v0.15.1).
- **Python**: Installed (v3.13.5).
- **Node.js**: Not found.
- **Decision**: Architecture will likely be Python-based (Flask/FastAPI/Streamlit) to accommodate environment constraints while aiming for a premium UI.

## Constraints
- **Reliability First**: No guessing at business logic.
- **Offline/Local**: Must use local Ollama instance.
